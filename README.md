# VERA Skincare Landing Page – Vue.js + GSAP Recreation

A smooth, animation-focused single-page site inspired by the VERA skincare design shared by @satyaa on X.com.

This version is built with **Vue 3** + **GSAP** (no Framer involved) — scroll-triggered leaf animations, parallax laptop section, interactive ingredient cards, fluid reveals, and responsive design across devices.
